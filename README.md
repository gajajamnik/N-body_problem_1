# N-body_problem
Numerical simulation of the classical N-body problem using MATLAB. Includes implementations for solving differential equations, handling singularities, and visualizing particle trajectories. Features examples of famous three-body solutions (Euler, Lagrange, figure-eight) and allows for custom initial conditions.
